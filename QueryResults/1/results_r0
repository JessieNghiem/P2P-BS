Text review: What I love about Port of Subs is the consistency in the sandwiches at all locations.  I tend to treat this location as my kitchen since when I'm too busy to buy groceries or generally lazy I just stop in for breakfast for lunch.  I do love the freshly sliced meats and ingredients along with great service.  I know this location gets busy but they always remember my order and even speed through the grillers I order on a regular basis.  If you're looking for a sandwich place with friendly service, made to order, and plenty of options this is the place.

Text review: Ya another chain, I know but get over it!

This location is almost never busy.  It's tucked away next to Sauce and on the other side of The Living Room.  I am always greeted with a friendly hello and served promptly.  This location is super clean too.  I cannot stand it when the soda station is sticky and messy but not here....they keep it very clean and organized.  

They don't have as many items on their menu but what they have they do very well.  The bread is always fresh and the veggies are crisp.  I'm guessing they do a good business at lunchtime due to the other businesses around them.  I've been in on off hours and I'm usually the only one there or there is one other person.  Overall this is a great location!

Text review: I love Port of Subs, and discovered this one near my new job that I started this week. I like it here for a few different reasons, and they have a lot going for them.  I noticed a few low reviews, but wanted to chime in and give my two cents as to how much I like it here.

For starters, they have two lines, which really helps since it seems to be in a busy part of town. There's a lot of business's around and it's close to the airport so I'm sure they get a lot of foot traffic going in and out.  I like that they have two service lines, so there's literally no wait here for getting your food in a short amount of time.  The staff here has been really nice, and seem to get my order out quickly.

The downside? For starters, the drink station was kinda dirty today, and even though there was a staff member there when I went to refill my drink, she didn't seem to try to clean up the watery mess from someone who must have made a mess between the time I got my first drink and the 15 minutes later when I went to go refill my cup. It appeared that someone splashed a bunch of water all over the counter or ice cubes had been spilled and melted and caused a bit off a pool of water.  It was somewhat disarming since I was in work clothes and didn't want to get stains on my shirt, and I had a book with me and really didn't want to get that wet either.  

They seem to get a lot of repeat business here since it is in somewhat of a business district. I know they do a punch card system, and I didn't think about it until much later in the day and wish a staff member had said something. I guess they must not be big on enforcing it? Seems like other business's are jamming punch cards down my throat to get me back in the door, but not this port of subs.

Overall a good experience and I'm sure I'll be back in the future.

Text review: As a vegetarian, Port of Subs is one of the few fast food/casual dining type places I can/will eat at. I looove a veggie sub from Port of Subs. 

They slice the cheese (and meat) here, it's much more appetizing than the cheese/meat you see sitting there at Subway and other sandwich shops. 

The main bonuses here, other than fresh slicing, are the sourdough bread and pepperjack cheese (never know if other sandwich shops have either of those), and first and foremost the mayo/mustard mix. I always get a ton of it. The only reason I took one star off my review is that lately, the mayo/mustard mix tastes a bit different (although that may just be my taste buds??), which was, honestly, the main draw for me, so I find myself coming here less often. 

I also really, really appreciate that they clean the machine before slicing the cheese for a veggie (#6) sandwich here. They say it is their policy to do so, but not every location does so...and I have learned to make sure the machine is cleaned first, after I got a sandwich with some slices of meat on it from another location. I appreciate that they do this without my having to ask (esp. since I always feel a little bit bad asking them to take the time to do so, esp. @ lunchtime, when this location gets crazy busy). 

Also love the frequent customer type card, buy 12 get one free! Always makes me happy to get a free, delicious sandwich.

Text review: Had lunch today here.. oh yeah, big ol' ham and cheese sandwich... It was way better then subways, and Quinoz.. at least the ones near my house anyways.  The shop was nice and clean, a little busy because it was lunchtime, but the workers were on their game and made those sandwiches pretty fast to get me back to work on time.

They had a special that is crazy.. 2 feet of sandwich, any cold ones for $9.99. So I split the cost and got a whole foot long for like $5. It's not the wimpy ones at other $5 foot long deals.. It was huge, had all the fixings, and I could only eat half of it.. So oh yeah, you know what I'm having for supper... MMMM... Can't Wait! good food, meat and cheese were nice and fresh, they didn't skimp on the toppings... good deal, I'll be back..

Text review: My girls loves Port of Subs and want to eat here all the time.  I have three favorite locations and one that we call "the stingy Port of Subs" - this locations is one of our favorites - clean, not too busy, fairly efficient employees - it is Port of Subs, so the food is the same everywhere, but we like locations that are clean and pleasant - this is one of those locations.

Text review: My girls loves Port of Subs and want to eat here all the time.  I have three favorite locations and one that we call "the stingy Port of Subs" - this locations is one of our favorites - clean, not too busy, fairly efficient employees - it is Port of Subs, so the food is the same everywhere, but we like locations that are clean and pleasant - this is one of those locations.

Text review: What I love about Port of Subs is the consistency in the sandwiches at all locations.  I tend to treat this location as my kitchen since when I'm too busy to buy groceries or generally lazy I just stop in for breakfast for lunch.  I do love the freshly sliced meats and ingredients along with great service.  I know this location gets busy but they always remember my order and even speed through the grillers I order on a regular basis.  If you're looking for a sandwich place with friendly service, made to order, and plenty of options this is the place.

Text review: Ya another chain, I know but get over it!

This location is almost never busy.  It's tucked away next to Sauce and on the other side of The Living Room.  I am always greeted with a friendly hello and served promptly.  This location is super clean too.  I cannot stand it when the soda station is sticky and messy but not here....they keep it very clean and organized.  

They don't have as many items on their menu but what they have they do very well.  The bread is always fresh and the veggies are crisp.  I'm guessing they do a good business at lunchtime due to the other businesses around them.  I've been in on off hours and I'm usually the only one there or there is one other person.  Overall this is a great location!

Text review: I love Port of Subs, and discovered this one near my new job that I started this week. I like it here for a few different reasons, and they have a lot going for them.  I noticed a few low reviews, but wanted to chime in and give my two cents as to how much I like it here.

For starters, they have two lines, which really helps since it seems to be in a busy part of town. There's a lot of business's around and it's close to the airport so I'm sure they get a lot of foot traffic going in and out.  I like that they have two service lines, so there's literally no wait here for getting your food in a short amount of time.  The staff here has been really nice, and seem to get my order out quickly.

The downside? For starters, the drink station was kinda dirty today, and even though there was a staff member there when I went to refill my drink, she didn't seem to try to clean up the watery mess from someone who must have made a mess between the time I got my first drink and the 15 minutes later when I went to go refill my cup. It appeared that someone splashed a bunch of water all over the counter or ice cubes had been spilled and melted and caused a bit off a pool of water.  It was somewhat disarming since I was in work clothes and didn't want to get stains on my shirt, and I had a book with me and really didn't want to get that wet either.  

They seem to get a lot of repeat business here since it is in somewhat of a business district. I know they do a punch card system, and I didn't think about it until much later in the day and wish a staff member had said something. I guess they must not be big on enforcing it? Seems like other business's are jamming punch cards down my throat to get me back in the door, but not this port of subs.

Overall a good experience and I'm sure I'll be back in the future.

Text review: As a vegetarian, Port of Subs is one of the few fast food/casual dining type places I can/will eat at. I looove a veggie sub from Port of Subs. 

They slice the cheese (and meat) here, it's much more appetizing than the cheese/meat you see sitting there at Subway and other sandwich shops. 

The main bonuses here, other than fresh slicing, are the sourdough bread and pepperjack cheese (never know if other sandwich shops have either of those), and first and foremost the mayo/mustard mix. I always get a ton of it. The only reason I took one star off my review is that lately, the mayo/mustard mix tastes a bit different (although that may just be my taste buds??), which was, honestly, the main draw for me, so I find myself coming here less often. 

I also really, really appreciate that they clean the machine before slicing the cheese for a veggie (#6) sandwich here. They say it is their policy to do so, but not every location does so...and I have learned to make sure the machine is cleaned first, after I got a sandwich with some slices of meat on it from another location. I appreciate that they do this without my having to ask (esp. since I always feel a little bit bad asking them to take the time to do so, esp. @ lunchtime, when this location gets crazy busy). 

Also love the frequent customer type card, buy 12 get one free! Always makes me happy to get a free, delicious sandwich.

Text review: Had lunch today here.. oh yeah, big ol' ham and cheese sandwich... It was way better then subways, and Quinoz.. at least the ones near my house anyways.  The shop was nice and clean, a little busy because it was lunchtime, but the workers were on their game and made those sandwiches pretty fast to get me back to work on time.

They had a special that is crazy.. 2 feet of sandwich, any cold ones for $9.99. So I split the cost and got a whole foot long for like $5. It's not the wimpy ones at other $5 foot long deals.. It was huge, had all the fixings, and I could only eat half of it.. So oh yeah, you know what I'm having for supper... MMMM... Can't Wait! good food, meat and cheese were nice and fresh, they didn't skimp on the toppings... good deal, I'll be back..

Text review: Had lunch today here.. oh yeah, big ol' ham and cheese sandwich... It was way better then subways, and Quinoz.. at least the ones near my house anyways.  The shop was nice and clean, a little busy because it was lunchtime, but the workers were on their game and made those sandwiches pretty fast to get me back to work on time.

They had a special that is crazy.. 2 feet of sandwich, any cold ones for $9.99. So I split the cost and got a whole foot long for like $5. It's not the wimpy ones at other $5 foot long deals.. It was huge, had all the fixings, and I could only eat half of it.. So oh yeah, you know what I'm having for supper... MMMM... Can't Wait! good food, meat and cheese were nice and fresh, they didn't skimp on the toppings... good deal, I'll be back..

Text review: My girls loves Port of Subs and want to eat here all the time.  I have three favorite locations and one that we call "the stingy Port of Subs" - this locations is one of our favorites - clean, not too busy, fairly efficient employees - it is Port of Subs, so the food is the same everywhere, but we like locations that are clean and pleasant - this is one of those locations.
